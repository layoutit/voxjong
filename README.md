# Voxjong

Voxjong is a browser-based 3D CSS Mahjong Solitaire game that renders the board
as real HTML/CSS 3D geometry through [VoxCSS](https://github.com/LayoutitStudio/voxcss),
without a WebGL or canvas renderer. The game generates a solvable turtle layout
in TypeScript, projects the active Mahjong tiles into textured CSS cubes, and
ships as a static Nuxt app.

## How to Play

Install dependencies and run the local dev server:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

For production checks:

```sh
npm run check
npm run generate
npm run audit
```

`npm run check` runs the focused rule/render tests and a Nuxt production build.
`npm run generate` writes static output to the ignored `dist/` folder.

## How It Works

Voxjong uses VoxCSS for DOM-based 3D rendering. Each Mahjong tile becomes one or
more real DOM elements positioned in 3D with CSS transforms and textured with
the bundled tile PNGs, instead of being drawn into a canvas.

`src/game/mahjong.ts` owns the board model: turtle layout coordinates, solvable
deal generation, free-tile blocking checks, and Mahjong pair matching including
flower and season groups.

`src/composables/useMahjongSession.ts` owns the playable session state: active
tiles, selection, hints, timer, undo, redo, and new-game resets. `src/render`
then maps that game state into VoxCSS scene data for the runtime in
`src/app.vue`.

## Build and Runtime

The browser does not fetch or generate tile art at runtime. Tile, logo, and
social images are bundled from `src/assets/`, validated during module load, and
referenced by the generated Nuxt build.

Voxjong is designed as a static site. The generated Nuxt output is ignored by
Git, so the repository keeps source, tests, and bundled assets without checking
in build output.
